draft = false
abstract = "Wind connectivity has been identified as a key factor driving many biological processes. Existing software available for managing wind data are often overly complex for studying many ecological processes and cannot be incorporated into a broad framework. Here we present rWind, an R langauge package to download and manage surface wind data from the Global Forecasting System and to compute wind connectivity between locations. Data obtained with rWind can be used in a general framework for analysis of biological processes to develop hypotheses about the role of wind in driving ecological and evolutionary patterns."
